# vr-paint
 Team 25 - Aaron, One, and Sophia  
 Web app for texture painting 3D models  

To build this project, download Wonderland Engine and https://wonderlandengine.com/ and open VRTexturePaint.wle. You can build the project to the web by pressing the green play button in the center of the top row.  

This project is meant to be viewed with a VR headset. The UI shows up based on the location of the right controller so it will not show up on PC. You can connect a VR headset to your PC through a USB-C cable. The headset this application was tested on was a Quest 2. You may have to configure the settings to allow building through USB-C in the settings of your Quest 2.  

You can refer to our test video if you do not have access to a VR headset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXWSYQZNcg9MVm1Kaa2IRGg9fY5TeXjF/view?usp=sharing
